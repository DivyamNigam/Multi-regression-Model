# Multi-regression-Model
A multiple regression model is used to check the best Regression model for the highest prediction score.

Using GridsearchCV Testing data on multiple regression models on Linear regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree regression.
To make a model that can predict the price of a house using 8 independent variables.

Plotting it to graph was intersesting, I got this trendline.

Then I figured out why, this was because multiple variable plotted against one y on the graph with different axis, gives us this with R^2 68%(I know not that good but with the data its pretty good, its the best I had among other models) So thats regression line is like that.
